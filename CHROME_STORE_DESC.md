## Why Install TabBoost?

TabBoost transforms how you interact with links and tabs in Chrome with these powerful features:

**üöÄ Preview Links Without Leaving Your Page**
Hold the Command key (Mac) or Ctrl key (Windows - configurable) while clicking any link to open it in an elegant popup window right on your current page. No more opening dozens of tabs or losing your place ‚Äì quickly preview content and decide if it's worth opening in a full tab.

**üì∫ Split View Mode for Multitasking**
Work smarter, not harder! TabBoost's unique Split View mode allows you to view two web pages side-by-side within a single tab. Perfect for comparing content, referencing information, or handling multiple related tasks without constant tab switching. Activate it easily via keyboard shortcut or the extension popup menu.

**‚ö° Enhanced iframe Compatibility (NEW in v2.4.0)**
We've completely revamped how TabBoost handles website previews with our advanced compatibility system:

- **Seamless Previews:** Using Chrome's powerful declarativeNetRequest API, TabBoost now automatically modifies response headers to enable iframe loading for almost all websites.
- **Smart Header Modification:** The extension intelligently manages Content Security Policy (CSP) and X-Frame-Options restrictions to maximize compatibility.
- **User Control:** A simple toggle in settings lets you enable/disable this feature if needed, with detailed explanations of what it does.
- **Configurable Ignore List:** For sites that still don't work, you can add them to an Ignore List to always open in a new tab instead.

**‚ú® Instant Tab Duplication**
Quickly duplicate your current tab with a simple keyboard shortcut (`Ctrl+M` by default, customizable in Chrome's settings). Ideal for comparison shopping, keeping reference pages open, or managing similar tasks.

**üñ±Ô∏è One-Click URL Copying**
Instantly copy any page's URL to your clipboard using a keyboard shortcut (`Shift+Command+C` on Mac, `Alt+C` on Windows by default - customizable). A subtle notification confirms the action.

**üíæ Web Page Save Confirmation**
Intercepts the `Command+S` (Mac) or `Ctrl+S` (Windows) save shortcut, displaying a confirmation dialog to prevent accidentally saving the webpage instead of a file. After confirmation, you have a 3-second window to use the native save function.

**üö´ Save Shortcut Override**
Intercepts the native `Command/Ctrl+S` page save, replacing the disruptive dialog with a subtle bottom-right notification for a smoother user experience.

**üîß Highly Customizable**
Tailor TabBoost to your workflow:

- **Choose Default Action:** Decide what the extension icon click does (copy URL, duplicate tab, toggle split view, etc.).
- **Adjust Popup Size:** Select preset sizes or define custom width/height for the preview window, now with enhanced custom size settings and label updates based on user selection.
- **Enable/Disable Features:** Toggle Split View or header modification functionality on/off.
- **Customize Shortcuts:** Change default keyboard shortcuts via `chrome://extensions/shortcuts`.

**üåê Multiple Language Support**
TabBoost now supports multiple languages, including English, Chinese (Simplified and Traditional), German, Spanish, French, Japanese, Korean, Russian, and Thai, making it accessible to users worldwide.

**üí° Seamless Experience**
TabBoost integrates naturally into Chrome, using minimal resources while delivering powerful productivity enhancements that feel built-in.

**üé® New Icon Design**
We've updated the extension icon for a more modern and clearer visual experience, making it stand out better in your browser toolbar.
