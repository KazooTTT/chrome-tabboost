## Why Install TabBoost?

TabBoost transforms how you interact with links and tabs in Chrome with these powerful features:

**üöÄ Preview Links Without Leaving Your Page**
Hold the Command key (Mac) or Ctrl key (Windows - configurable) while clicking any link to open it in an elegant popup window right on your current page. No more opening dozens of tabs or losing your place ‚Äì quickly preview content and decide if it's worth opening in a full tab.

**üì∫ Split View Mode for Multitasking**
Work smarter, not harder! TabBoost's unique Split View mode allows you to view two web pages side-by-side within a single tab. Perfect for comparing content, referencing information, or handling multiple related tasks without constant tab switching. Activate it easily via keyboard shortcut or the extension popup menu.

**‚öôÔ∏è Smart iframe Compatibility Handling**
We know not all websites play nicely in popups or split views (due to their `X-Frame-Options` or CSP). TabBoost handles this intelligently:

- **Automatic Detection:** It tries to load the site; if embedding is blocked, you'll be notified.
- **Flexible Options:** Choose to open the link in a new tab or add the site to an "Ignore List".
- **Configurable Ignore List:** Manage your Ignore List in the settings. Add specific domains or wildcards (`*.example.com`). Sites on this list will _always_ open in a new tab, bypassing the preview/split view for a seamless experience. You can even enable an option to automatically add problematic sites to this list.

**‚ú® Instant Tab Duplication**
Quickly duplicate your current tab with a simple keyboard shortcut (`Ctrl+M` by default, customizable in Chrome's settings). Ideal for comparison shopping, keeping reference pages open, or managing similar tasks.

**üñ±Ô∏è One-Click URL Copying**
Instantly copy any page's URL to your clipboard using a keyboard shortcut (`Shift+Command+C` on Mac, `Alt+C` on Windows by default - customizable). A subtle notification confirms the action.

**üíæ Web Page Save Confirmation**
Intercepts the `Command+S` (Mac) or `Ctrl+S` (Windows) save shortcut, displaying a confirmation dialog to prevent accidentally saving the webpage instead of a file. After confirmation, you have a 3-second window to use the native save function.

**üö´ Save Shortcut Override**
Intercepts the native `Command/Ctrl+S` page save, replacing the disruptive dialog with a subtle bottom-right notification for a smoother user experience.

**üîß Highly Customizable**
Tailor TabBoost to your workflow:

- **Choose Default Action:** Decide what the extension icon click does (copy URL, duplicate tab, toggle split view, etc.).
- **Adjust Popup Size:** Select preset sizes or define custom width/height for the preview window, now with enhanced custom size settings and label updates based on user selection.
- **Enable/Disable Features:** Toggle Split View or the entire iframe ignore functionality on/off.
- **Customize Shortcuts:** Change default keyboard shortcuts via `chrome://extensions/shortcuts`.

**üåê Multiple Language Support**
TabBoost now supports multiple languages, including English, Chinese (Simplified and Traditional), German, Spanish, French, Japanese, Korean, Russian, and Thai, making it accessible to users worldwide.

**üí° Seamless Experience**
TabBoost integrates naturally into Chrome, using minimal resources while delivering powerful productivity enhancements that feel built-in.

**üé® New Icon Design**
We've updated the extension icon for a more modern and clearer visual experience, making it stand out better in your browser toolbar.

If you love Arc Browser's innovative features but prefer Chrome, TabBoost is the perfect solution. It brings the best of both worlds together, enhancing your productivity without forcing a browser switch.
